# We need to create a zip file as so:
# * Add the content of the root directory python files (and just the files in this directory. Sorry, submodules :/
# * Add the contet of the site-packages directory in venv to the root of the zip file.
# * boto3 comes pre-installed, so we don't need that (or deps).
# * We also don't need this deployment file.
